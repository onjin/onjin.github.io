# Added new physical partition /dev/sda3

# create a physical volume out of it

&gt; pvcreate /dev/sda3



# Now, add it to the volume group

#that my logical volume is on

&gt; vgextend VolGroup00 /dev/sda3



# Now that the volume group has more

# disk space, the logical volume can grow

&gt; lvextend -L+11G /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00



# Ok, last of all, I want to filesystem to

# recognize that more space is available

&gt; fsadm resize /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00



# sweet, I have more space now
