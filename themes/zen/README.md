The zen and zen-based themes are very customizable, so to make these themes work, you have to use this [conf.py](https://github.com/damianavila/damian_blog/blob/master/conf.py), obviously with your custom changes ;-)

More info about the zen themes family [here](http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/nikolas-zen-theme-finally-released.html).

Enjoy!
